    -- Chapter I --
    No ordinary day

 = Camera stops over factory building, fades to entry
 = Camera flows over robots moving slowly around belts
 = Stop over two talking robots (R1, R2)
    R1: Is everything going according to the plan?
    R2: There...are...some..c-c-complications...
    R1: What does it mean "com-pli-ca-tions" ?!? [jumps nervously]
    R2: I don't think we're gonna make it till end of the week
    
 = Over screen walks unknown human (UH), approaches robots (R1, R2).
    UH: Excuse me, can you tell me, where should I put my job application?
 = Robots still talks to each other
    R1: I don't want to hear that, we are acting according to plan
    R2: Try harder or you'll end up on the scrap yard!
 = Human interrupts once again
    UH: S-s-sorry, uhm, eee, can you two guys help me?
 = Robots are still doing their own bussines
    R1: Our registers shown we're expecting today at least 10 humans
    R2: Yeah, but...
    R1: But? BUT !?! I will kick your BUTT if you 'but' me again!
 = Human tries once again
    UH: Hey, I really don't want to interrupt you, but I'm in a little hurry.
    R1: [turns his face to UH]: WHAT ???!!!
    UH: Oh, right, yes. Now, can you show me where is job application office?
    R2: [also turns his head]: WHAT ???!!!
    UH: Office. Job office. Where I can go and put my job application. Where is it?
 = R1 and R2 look at each other, then UH, then once again at each, then
   simultaneously moves back 2 steps and shows a little ballon with exclamation
   marks over their heads. Waits a while, and both of them moves back to UH
     R2: You serious?
     UH: Yeah, what's the matter?
     R1: Didn't you hit your head or something?
     UH: No, I'm pretty fine
     R2: But you are aware this a ROBOT factory, where only ROBOTS work, right?
     UH: Of course, I have read it at sign in front of the entrance
     R1: You also know that...akhem...
     R1: FOR THE LAST 300 YEARS NO HUMAN DOESN'T HAVE TO WORK ANYMORE ?!?
     R2: [side-text-frame] Are you out of your mind?
     UH: Yup, that is correct. After the invention of [Thought-Propelled Brain] 
         robots became self-aware and from that day on they replaced humans in all
         labour-related tasks. After that, every single human retired and devoted
         himself to all pleasures free time can ensure.
     R2: Exaclty, so, what's your reason? 
     R2: Can't you just enjoy your happy life without any work-concerns? 
         Just leave them to us, that's what we are created for after all!
     UH: ....nah, that's fine. I just got bored and wanted to try something
         different, that's all
     R1: [thinks for the moment] .... .... .... ....
     R1: Well, I can not promise you anything, but...come with me
 = UH and R1 walks slowly outside the screen, while walking
     R1: [turns head to R2] Get back to work!!!
 = R2 starts to move rapidly in all directions. UH and R1 continue walking, 
   screen fades
