    -- Chapter I --
    No ordinary day

 = Camera moves over the whole factory district, showing robots wandering
   to/from work

 = Camera stops over factory building, fades to entry, showing hallway

 = Camera flows over robots moving slowly around belts

 = Stop over two talking robots (R1, R2)

    R1: Is everything going according to the plan?
    R2: There...are...some..c-c-complications...
    R1: What does it mean "com-pli-ca-tions" ?!? [jumps nervously]
    R2: I don't think we're gonna make it till end of the week
    
 = Over screen walks unknown human (UH), approaches robots (R1, R2).

    UH: Excuse me, can you tell me, where should I put my job application?

 = Robots still talks to each other

    R1: I don't want to hear that, we are acting according to plan
    R2: Try harder or you'll end up on the scrap yard!

 = Human interrupts once again

    UH: S-s-sorry, uhm, eee, can you two guys help me?

 = Robots are still doing their own bussines

    R1: Our registers shown we're expecting today at least 10 humans
    R2: Yeah, but...
    R1: But? BUT !?! I will kick your BUTT if you 'but' me again!

 = Human tries once again

    UH: Hey, I really don't want to interrupt you, but I'm in a little hurry.
    R1: [turns his face to UH]: WHAT ???!!!
    UH: Oh, right, yes. Now, can you show me where is job application office?
    R2: [also turns his head]: WHAT ???!!!
    UH: Office. Job office. Where I can go and put my job application. Where is it?
 
 = R1 and R2 look at each other, then UH, then once again at each, then
   simultaneously moves back 2 steps and shows a little ballon with exclamation
   marks over their heads. Waits a while, and both of them moves back to UH
 
    R2: You serious?
    UH: Yeah, what's the matter?
    R1: Didn't you hit your head or something?
    UH: No, I'm pretty fine
    R2: But you are aware this a ROBOT factory, where only ROBOTS work, right?
    UH: Of course, I have read it at sign in front of the entrance
    R1: You also know that...akhem...
    R1: FOR THE LAST 300 YEARS NO HUMAN DOESN'T HAVE TO WORK ANYMORE ?!?
    R2: [side-text-frame] Are you out of your mind?
    UH: Yup, that is correct. After the invention of [Thought-Propelled Brain] 
        robots became self-aware and from that day on they replaced humans in all
        labour-related tasks. After that, every single human retired and devoted
        himself to all pleasures free time can ensure.
    R2: Exaclty, so, what's your reason? 
    R2: Can't you just enjoy your happy life without any work-concerns? 
        Just leave them to us, that's what we are created for after all!
    UH: ....nah, that's fine. I just got bored and wanted to try something
        different, that's all
    R1: [thinks for the moment] .... .... .... ....
    R1: Well, I can not promise you anything, but...come with me
 
 = UH and R1 walks slowly outside the screen, while walking
    R1: [turns head to R2] Get back to work!!!
 
 = R2 starts to move rapidly in all directions. UH and R1 continue walking, 
   screen fades 
 
 = SCENE CUTS
 
 = UH with R1 walk slowly through main factory area    
 
    R1: So, where'd you come from?
    UH: Uhmm... I really don't have any place to dwell longer than couple of weeks.
        Seems, hiking is my nature.
    R1: But you need to stay SOMEWHERE, if you want to work here, not?
    UH: We'll see, we'll see...
 
 = Scene fades, UH with R1 walk slowly up the corridor to job office
 
    R1: Anyway, do you know you role here? See, all the tasks are fairly covered by us
    UH: Maybe Human Contact Department?
    R1: Taken. By Autonomous Call Center
    UH: Wishes Machines' Mechanic?
    R1: They never break. Besides, human brain IQ alone can't handle such complicated
        machinery
    UH: OK, then Marketing Agent!
    R1: Hahaha - first human ever, eager to work, wants to praise our relaxing services
 
 = Scene fades, they enter job office
